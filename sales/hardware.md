(“GRAVWELL") AND THE CUSTOMER (“CUSTOMER”) IDENTIFIED ON THE APPLICABLE SALES QUOTATION REFERENCING AND INCORPORATING THESE TERMS FOR CUSTOMER’S PURCHASE OF THE GRAVWELL HARDWARE PRODUCT(S) SPECIFIC ON THE SALES QUOTATION (“HARDWARE”).  GRAVWELL WILL NOT BE BOUND BY ANY TERMS OF CUSTOMER'S ORDER THAT ARE IN ADDITION TO OR INCONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS HEREIN. ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMER OF THESE TERMS WILL BE DEEMED MADE AT THE EARLIER OF CUSTOMER'S (1) ACCEPTANCE OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT OF THESE TERMS WITHOUT WRITTEN REJECTION THERETO, (2) PLACEMENT OF A PURCHASE ORDER WITH GRAVWELL THAT REFERS TO A VALID GRAVWELL QUOTATION WHICH QUOTATION REFERENCES THESE TERMS, OR FAILURE TO EXPRESSLY REJECT THESE TERMS IN SUCH PURCHASE ORDER, OR (3) FAILURE TO DELIVER TO GRAVWELL WRITTEN NOTICE OF ITS EXPRESS REJECTION OF THESE TERMS WITHIN FIVE (5) DAYS FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF GRAVWELL’S ORDER ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT REFERENCES THESE TERMS IF CUSTOMER HAS EXPRESSLY REJECTED THESE TERMS IN THE PURCHASE ORDER PLACED BY CUSTOMER.**

## 1. Applicability. 
These Terms apply to all quotations, order forms, purchase orders, and acknowledgments relating to sales of Hardware by Gravwell to Customer. Acceptance of any Customer order by Gravwell is made only on the express condition that these Terms shall govern. Gravwell’s failure to object to provisions contained in any communication from Customer will not be deemed a waiver of any provision herein. Any additional or different terms proposed by Customer are hereby deemed material, are objected to, and are rejected by Gravwell unless specifically accepted in a hand-signed writing by an authorized representative of Gravwell.

## 2. Orders
### _2.1. Order Submission by Customer_
**(a)** Sales Quote. With respect to each sale of Hardware, Gravwell will provide a quote for Customer’s purchase of the Hardware (**“Sales Quotation”**) to Customer containing a description of the Hardware offered to Customer, and the applicable pricing, quantity ordered, delivery destination, estimated shipment date, and other terms. Each order of Hardware will be subject to these Terms and any additional terms expressly contained in the applicable Sales Quotation.

**(b)** Purchase Orders.  Upon Customer’s execution of the Sales Quotation, or Customer’s submission of a purchase order referencing the Sales Quotation, or the parties mutually execution of an order form or similar ordering document referencing the Sales Quotation (in each case, hereinafter, a **“Purchase Order”**).

### _2.2. Purchase Order Approval._ 
Customer acknowledges that where a Purchase Order is submitted by or on behalf of Customer in response to a Sales Quotation, such Purchase Orders are subject to approval and acceptance by Gravwell, which shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of (a) Gravwell’s written acknowledgement of the Purchase Order, (b) Gravwell’s issuance of an invoice to Customer for the purchase of the Hardware, or (c) the delivery of the Hardware to Customer.  All other Purchase Orders shall be deemed accepted and approved upon execution by both parties.

### _2.3. Price Changes._
If Customer places an order for Hardware for delivery more than 3 months from the date of the Purchase Order, Gravwell reserves the right, by giving notice to the Customer at any time before delivery, to increase the price of such Hardware that has not been delivered to reflect any increase in the cost to Gravwell which is due to market conditions or any factor beyond the control of Gravwell (including without limitation any foreign exchange fluctuation, currency regulation, alteration of duties, change in legislation, significant increase in the costs of labor, materials or other costs of manufacture), any change in delivery dates, quantities or specifications for the Hardware which is requested by the Customer, or any delay caused by any instructions of the Customer or failure of the Customer to give Gravwell adequate information or instructions.

### _2.4. Cancellations._ 
Purchase Orders may not be cancelled by Customer, except with the agreement in writing of Gravwell, and provided that Customer indemnifies Gravwell in full against all loss (including without limitation loss of profit), costs (including without limitation the cost of all labor and materials used), damages, charges and expenses incurred by Gravwell as a result of cancellation.

### _2.5. Changes._ 
Gravwell reserves the right (but does not assume the obligation) to make any changes in the specifications for the Hardware which are required to conform with any applicable legislation or, where the Hardware is to be supplied to the Customer's specification, which do not materially affect its quality or performance.

## 3. Shipment and Delivery
### _3.1. Shipping Terms._ 
All Hardware will be packed for shipment and delivered using Gravwell's standard methods for packaging and shipping to Customer or its carrier agent at Gravwell’s facility or its authorized subcontractors’ or distributors’ facilities, (the **“Delivery Point”**) at which time risk of loss and title will pass to Customer. Gravwell may make partial shipments, to be separately invoiced and paid for when due. Gravwell will use reasonable efforts to meet Customer’s requested delivery schedules for Hardware, but delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to accept the remaining deliveries. Upon delivery of all or part of any Hardware to the Delivery Point, such sales will be deemed final.

### _3.2. Security._  
As collateral security for the payment of the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 4.1 below), Customer hereby grants to Gravwell a lien on and security interest in and to all of the right, title, and interest of Customer in, to, and under the Hardware, wherever located, and whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired from time to time, and in all accessions thereto and replacements or modifications thereof, as well as all proceeds (including insurance proceeds) of the foregoing. The security interest granted under this provision constitutes a purchase money security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code.

### _3.3. Delivery._ 
Delivery dates and Hardware availability as set forth in the Sales Quotation or as otherwise communicated to Customer are estimates only. Gravwell will make reasonable efforts to deliver in accordance with these dates; however, Gravwell will not be liable for failure to deliver as estimated. The Hardware may be delivered by Gravwell in advance of the quoted delivery date by giving reasonable notice to the Customer. Gravwell may deliver the Hardware in separate installments.  Customer shall be responsible for all loading costs and provide equipment and labor reasonably suited for receipt of the Hardware at Customer’s shipping address specified in the Sales Quotation.  Customer is responsible for fees associated with not taking timely delivery of the Hardware, such as storage fees.

### _3.4. Inspection._
**(a)** Customer shall inspect the Hardware within 2 business days of receipt (**"Inspection Period"**). Customer will be deemed to have accepted the Hardware unless it notifies Gravwell in writing of any Nonconforming Hardware (as defined below) during the Inspection Period and furnishes such written evidence or other documentation as reasonably required by Gravwell. **"Nonconforming Hardware"** means only the following: (i) the product shipped is different than identified in the Sales Quotation; or (ii) the product's label or packaging incorrectly identifies its contents. 

**(b)** If Customer timely notifies Gravwell of any Nonconforming Hardware, Gravwell shall, in its sole discretion, (i) replace such Nonconforming Hardware with conforming Hardware, or (ii) credit or refund the Purchase Price for such Nonconforming Hardware, together with any reasonable third-party shipping and handling expenses actually incurred and paid by Customer in connection therewith. Customer shall ship, at its expense and risk of loss, the Nonconforming Hardware to the Gravwell facility specified by Gravwell. If Gravwell exercises its option to replace Nonconforming Hardware, Gravwell shall, after receiving Customer's shipment of Nonconforming Hardware, ship the replaced Hardware to Customer, at Customer's expense and risk of loss, in accordance with the shipping and delivery terms set forth above in this Section 3. 

**(c)** Customer acknowledges and agrees that the remedies set forth in Section 3.4(b) are Customer's exclusive remedies for Nonconforming Hardware. Except as provided under Sections 3.4(b) and 7.2, all sales of Hardware to Customer are made on a one-way basis and Customer has no right to return Hardware purchased under these Terms to Gravwell.

## 4. Price and Payment Terms
### _4.1. Purchase Price._ 
The purchase price for Hardware (“Purchase Price”) will be as set forth in the applicable Sales Quotation, which is valid for a period of 30 days, or such other period specified therein.

### _4.2. Payment_
**(a)** <ins>Invoices.</ins> Gravwell will invoice Customer upon acceptance and approval of the applicable Purchase Order as set forth in Section 2.2.  The invoice will state the Purchase Price for all Hardware plus any freight, Taxes (as defined below), or other applicable costs paid by Gravwell to be reimbursed by Customer.

**(b)** <ins>Payment Date and Late Payment.</ins> Unless otherwise stated in the Sales Quotation, Customer will pay all invoices no later than 30 days after the date of the invoice. If Customer fails to make payment in full on the due date, Gravwell may charge interest on past due amounts at the lesser of 1.5% per month and the highest rate allowed by applicable law.

### _4.3. Taxes._ 
Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Sales Quotation, Purchase Prices do not include, and are net of, any governmental taxes, including but not limited to national, state, or local sales, value added and use taxes, customs duties and other governmental assessments (**“Taxes”**). If all or any part of any payment owed to Gravwell under these Terms is withheld, based upon a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to Gravwell of the amounts otherwise payable under these Terms. Customer will be solely responsible for payment of all such Taxes and will indemnify and hold Gravwell harmless in the event of any claim related to Taxes.

### _4.4. Shipping Fees._ 
Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Sales Quotation, Purchase Prices are exclusive of delivery, packaging, packing, shipping, carriage, and insurance.  Where Gravwell is required to arrange shipping and/or insurance, the cost of doing so shall be added to the Purchase Price.

## 5. Compliance with Law. 
Customer shall at all times comply with all laws applicable to this Agreement, Customer's performance of its obligations hereunder, and Customer's use of the Hardware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall (a) at its own expense, maintain all certifications, credentials, licenses, and permits necessary to conduct its business relating to the purchase or use of the Hardware and (b) not engage in any activity or transaction involving the Hardware, by way of shipment, use, or otherwise, that violates any law.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Warranty Period shall automatically terminate upon any termination or expiration, for any reason: (a) of Customer’s subscription to the Gravwell Software, or (b) of the Software and Services Agreement.

### _7.2. Exclusions._  
The limited warranty under Section 7.1 does not apply, and Gravwell shall have no responsibility, obligations, or liability of any kind, where the Hardware have been: (a) subjected to abuse, misuse, neglect, negligence, accident, abnormal physical stress or environmental conditions, use contrary to any instructions issued by Gravwell, or improper testing, installation, storage, handling, repair, or maintenance, including, but not limited to, failure to house the Hardware in an environment that meets industry-standard requirements for server equipment, including but not limited to appropriate temperature, humidity, dust control, and physical security; (b) reconstructed, repaired, altered, or serviced by anyone other than Gravwell or its authorized representative; (c) used with any third-party product, hardware, or product that has not been previously approved in writing by Gravwell; (d) damaged or rendered defective by the use of parts not manufactured or sold by Gravwell; or (e) damaged due to electrical surges, fire, flood, excessive heat, or other external events beyond Gravwell’s control.

### _7.3. Remedy._  
During the Warranty Period: (a) Customer shall notify Gravwell, in writing, of any alleged warranty claim detailing the alleged non-conformance within 30 days from the date Customer discovers, or upon reasonable inspection should have discovered, such alleged claim (but in any event before the expiration of the applicable Warranty Period); and (b) Customer must obtain a Return Material Authorization (**"RMA"**) from Gravwell and ship the relevant Hardware, Customer’s expense and risk of loss, within 10 days of receipt of the RMA to the Gravwell facility specified by Gravwell for inspection and testing by Gravwell.  If Gravwell's inspection and testing reveals, to Gravwell's reasonable satisfaction, that such Hardware does not conform with the limited warranty set forth in Section 7.1, Gravwell shall in its sole discretion, and at its expense (subject to Customer's compliance with this 7), either (i) repair or replace such Hardware, or (ii) credit or refund the Purchase Price of such Hardware less any applicable discounts, rebates, or credits.  If Gravwell exercises its option to repair or replace, Gravwell shall ship to Customer, at Gravwell's expense, the repaired or replacement Hardware.  Gravwell shall have no obligation to accept return of any Hardware for which Gravwell has not issued an RMA.  Any replacement Hardware will be warranted solely for the remainder of the original Warranty Period and will not extend the original warranty.  Customer has no right to return for repair, replacement, credit, or refund any Hardware except as set forth in this 7.3.  In no event shall Customer reconstruct, repair, alter, or replace any Hardware, in whole or in part, either itself or by or through any third party.  **THIS 7.3 SETS FORTH THE CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND GRAVWELL'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN 7.1.**
