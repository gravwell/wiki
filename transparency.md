# Transparency

You have visibility into where your data lives, who has access to it, and how it is used.

## Access to data

Gravwell does not give any third-party direct or unfettered access to customer data, where customer data, means all data, including personal data, made available by the customer to Gravwell for use in connection with the Gravwell offerings, except as you direct, as stated in the applicable agreement, or when required by law.

Where possible, we redirect law enforcement and other third-party requests to the customer. If we receive a government or law enforcement request for customer data, we will promptly notify you and provide you with a copy of the request, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.

Further, we may challenge government or law enforcement requests for customer data that we consider to be overly broad or unlawful.

## Gravwell usage of your data
Gravwell may collect certain types of data to help us improve our solutions and services. We have defined rules for what, when, and how we use this data, and you decide which data is made available to us.

Gravwell does not collect any log data that you as a customer ingest into the Gravwell platform when deployed within the customer's infrastructure.

Gravwell does have the ability to see:
- What volume of data is being ingested
- The count of queries being run (manual and automated)
- The count of other feature usage such as number of flows
- Hardware specs

Gravwell does not collect the query strings of a search, the usernames of accounts, the tag names of data, the names of dashboards or other resources, or any other potentially confidential information from our customers who self-manage their deployment.

## Usage Metrics
