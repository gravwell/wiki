# Regex

Regex is a pipeline module that uses regular expressions to match text data. It is an extremely powerful way of matching complex patterns and extracting enumerable fields from text. For those unfamiliar with regular expressions, a decent starting point is [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression); you can also use [a regular expression playground](https://regex101.labs.gravwell.io/) to experiment.

Think of the `regex` module in similar terms to the grep command in Linux: any entries which do not match the regular expression will be dropped (unless the `-p` flag is set). Building regular expressions is well outside the scope of this document, but one extremely important feature is the `(?P<foo>\S+)` style syntax, which will assign any matched group into an enumerated value; in this case, it will capture and extract a sequence of non-space characters into an enumerated value named "foo".

For example, the following search will enumerate the method, user, and ip from an sshd Accepted log entry.

```
".*sshd.*Accepted (?P<method>\S*) for (?P<user>\S*) from (?P<ip>[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+)"
```

Because regular expressions can get very long, the regex module takes the `-r` flag, which specifies a resource containing a regular expression. When populating the resource, do not include "wrapping quotes" around the whole expression as you would when typing directly into a search: e.g. `".*ssh.*Accepted"` becomes `.*ssh.*Accepted`. This is because the quotes are normally stripped out by the search parser prior to being handed to the regex module.

## Syntax

An invocation of the `regex` module consists of the module name, any arguments which are being used, the regular expression, and then optionally any filters to be applied.

```
regex <argument list> <regular expression> [filter arguments]
```

### Supported Options

* `-e <arg>`: The “-e” option operates on an enumerated value instead of on the entire record. For example, a pipeline that showed packets not headed for port 80 but that have HTTP text would be `tag=pcap packet ipv4.DstPort!=80 tcp.Payload | regex -e Payload ".*GET \/ HTTP\/1.1.*"`
* `-r <arg>`: The “-r” option specifies that the regular expression statement is located in a resource file. 
* `-v`: The "-v" option tells regex to operate in inverse mode, dropping any entries which match the regex and passing entries which do not match.
* `-p`: The "-p" option tells regex to allow entries through if the regular expression does not match at all.  The permissive flag does not change the operation of filters.

```{note}
Storing especially large regular expressions in resource files can clean up queries, and allows for easy reuse.  If `-r` is specified, do not specify a regular expression in the query -- instead the contents of the resource will be used. Handy!
```

### Raw strings

To facilitate using escape sequences in regular expressions, you can use backticks to prevent Gravwell from unescaping your input. For example:

```gravwell
tag=syslog grep sshd | regex `shd.*Accepted (?P<method>\S*) for (?P<user>\S*) from (?P<ip>[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+)`
```

If you used double quotes instead of backticks, `\S` would have to be double-escaped as `\\S.` This feature is convenient in that it allows you to copy regular expressions directly from [regular expression playgrounds](https://regex101.labs.gravwell.io/) and other sources.

### Inline Filtering

The regex module supports inline filtering for down-selecting data directly within the regex module.  The inline filtering also enables regex to engage accelerators to dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.  Inline filtering is achieved in the same manner as other modules by using comparison operators.  If a filter is enabled that specifies equality ("equal", "not equal", "contains", "not contains") any entry that fails the filter specification will be dropped entirely.  If a field is specified as not equal "!=" and the field does not exist, the field is not extracted but the entry won't be dropped entirely.


| Operator | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| == | Equal | Field must be equal
| != | Not equal | Field must not be equal
| ~ | Subset | Field contains the value
| !~ | Not Subset | Field does NOT contain the value

#### Filtering Examples

The following query extracts auth methods, usernames, and IP addresses from SSH logs and filters down to only those entries where the username is "root" and the IP is in the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet.

```gravwell
tag=syslog regex `shd.*Accepted (?P<method>\S*) for (?P<user>\S*) from (?P<ip>[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+)` user==root ip ~ "192.168"
```

## Example Search

The following query extracts the authentication method, username, and source IP address from SSH logs as enumerated values named `method`, `user`, and `ip`, which are then displayed in a table.

```gravwell
tag=syslog grep sshd | regex `shd.*Accepted (?P<method>\S*) for (?P<user>\S*) from (?P<ip>[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+)` 
| table method user ip
```

## Full regular expression syntax

The following is copied from [the re2 documentation](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) (see [their license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/re2/refs/heads/main/LICENSE))

Regular expressions are a notation for describing sets of character
strings. When a particular string is in the set described by a regular
expression, we often say that the regular expression *matches* the
string.

The simplest regular expression is a single literal character. Except
for the metacharacters like `*+?()|`, characters match themselves. To
match a metacharacter, escape it with a backslash: `\+` matches a
literal plus character.

Two regular expressions can be alternated or concatenated to form a new
regular expression: if *e1* matches *s* and *e2* matches *t*, then
*e1*|*e2* matches *s* or *t*, and *e1e2* matches *st*.

The metacharacters `*`, `+`, and `?` are repetition operators: *e1*\*
matches a sequence of zero or more (possibly different) strings, each of
which match *e1*; *e1*+ matches one or more; *e1*? matches
zero or one.

The operator precedence, from weakest to strongest binding, is first
alternation, then concatenation, and finally the repetition operators.
Explicit parentheses can be used to force different meanings, just as in
arithmetic expressions. Some examples: `ab|cd` is equivalent to
`(ab)|(cd)`; `ab*` is equivalent to `a(b*)`.

The syntax described so far is most of the traditional Unix *egrep*
regular expression syntax. This subset suffices to describe all regular
languages: loosely speaking, a regular language is a set of strings that
can be matched in a single pass through the text using only a fixed
amount of memory. Newer regular expression facilities (notably Perl and
those that have copied it) have added many new operators and escape
sequences, which make the regular expressions more concise, and
sometimes more cryptic, but usually not more powerful.

This page lists the regular expression syntax accepted by RE2. Note that
this syntax is a subset of that accepted by PCRE, roughly speaking, and
with various
[caveats](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html#caveats).

It also lists some syntax accepted by PCRE, PERL, and VIM.
