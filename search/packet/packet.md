# Packet

The Packet pipeline module extracts fields from Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP packets.  Each field supports an operator which can selectively filter the packet, if no operator is provided the field is extracted if available.

The packet module is useful both for filtering traffic down to specific protocols and for extracting specific fields from packets for analysis--see the examples for more.

Some field modules allow flexible selection where it is desirable to filter on a field that may have a source and destination.  To accommodate selection on IPs, Ports, MACs where there are both a source and destination, the special fields Port, IP, MAC are available.  If either source or destination matches an enumerated value with the field will be populated with the component that matched.  For example, tcp.Port==80 will match whenever either tcp.SrcPort or tcp.DstPort are equal to 80; tcp.Port != 80 will ensure that if either the source or destination ports are 80 the packet is filtered.

## Supported Options

* `-e <arg>`: The “-e” option operates on an enumerated value instead of on the entire record. For example, the packet processing engine can operate on extracted values such as analyzing layer 2 tunnels.`

## Packet Processing Operators

| Operator | Name | Description
|----------|------|-------------
| == | Equal | Field must be equal
| != | Not equal | Field must not be equal
| < | Less than | Field must be less than
| > | Greater than | Field must be greater than
| <= | Less than or equal | Field must be less than or equal to
| >= | Greater than or equal | Field must be greater than or equal to
| ~ | Subset | Field must be a member of
| !~ | Not subset | Field must not be a member of

## Packet Processing Submodules

The packet processor supports submodules for breaking out specific fields in a packet. Each submodule and field supports a set of operators that allow the packet processor to also filter events based on the subfields.  The following sub modules are available:

| Submodule | Description                    |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| eth       | Ethernet frames                |
| ipv4      | IP Version 4 packets           |
| ipv6      | IP Version 6 packets           |
| tcp       | TCP packets                    |
| udp       | UDP packets                    |
| icmpv4    | ICMP packets                   |
| icmpv6    | ICMPv6 packets                |
| dot1q     | VLAN tagged frames             |
| dot11     | 802.11 Wireless packets        |
| dot11info | 802.11 information elements    |
| modbus    | modbus/TCP packets             |
| MPLS      | Multi-protocol Label Switching |

## Renaming Extractions

Enumerated value names are derived by the last name in a submodule specification. For example, the specification "ipv4.SrcIP" will generate the enumerated value "SrcIP". Enumerated value names can be overridden with an "as" argument. For example, to extract "ipv4.SrcIP" as "foo":

```gravwell
tag=pcap packet ipv4.SrcIP as foo | table foo
```

Renamed enumerated values can also be used with filters:

```gravwell
tag=pcap packet ipv4.SrcIP="8.8.8.8" as foo | table foo
```

## Examples

The following command will find all DNS queries for Tumblr:

```gravwell
tag=pcap packet udp.DstPort==53 udp.Payload | grep -e Payload "tumblr" | text
```

The `udp.DstPort==53` component specifies that we should only match on packets destined for UDP port 53, while the `udp.Payload` component specifies that the payload portion of each packet should be extracted into an enumerated value. We then use the `grep` module to search the payload for the word “tumblr” and send the results to the `text` renderer for display.

|-----|-------|-----------|---------

| modbus | ReqResp | | modbus.ReqResp
| modbus | Payload | | modbus.Payload

```{note}
The Modbus layer is typically the last layer, which means that the Payload value is almost always empty.  When parsing Modbus packets the ReqResp value will contain read/write command addresses and values.
```

### MPLS

The packet search module can decode MPLS headers and allows selective filtering.  The following MPLS fields are available.

| Packet type | Field | Operators | Example 
|-----|-------|-----------|---------
| mpls | Label | == != < > <= >= | mpls.Label==0x10
| mpls | TrafficClass | == != < > <= >= | mpls.TrafficClass==4
| mpls | StackBottom | == != | mpls.StackBottom==true
| mpls | TTL | == != < > <= >= | mpls.TTL>1
| mpls | Payload | == != ~ !~ | mpls.Payload~foo

For example, the following command will filter all traffic which contains MPLS headers and a traffic Label of 5

```gravwell
tag=pcap packet mpls.Label==5 mpls.TrafficClass mpls.Payload | grep -e Payload "HTTP" | count by TrafficClass | table TrafficClass count
```

```{note}
The MPLS package module will only look at the first MPLS layer, if there are multiple layers you will need to use the [packetlayer](/search/packetlayer/packetlayer) module to decode the additional layers by referencing the Payload enumerated value.
```

### ICS-specific protocols

Gravwell includes basic protocol crackers for Modbus, Ethernet/IP, and CIP. Due to the complexity of Ethernet/IP and CIP, only basic decoding is available, but this can still help establish baselines and detect anomalies.

| Packet type | Field | Operators | Example 
|-----|-------|-----------|---------
| modbus | Transaction | == != < > <= >= | modbus.Transaction != 0
| modbus | Protocol | == != < > <= >= | modbus.Protocol != 0
| modbus | Length | == != < > <= >= | modbus.Length > 1
| modbus | Unit | == != < > <= >= | modbus.Unit != 255
| modbus | Function | == != < > <= >= | modbus.Function == 0x0f
| modbus | Exception | ==true, !=true | modbus.Exception == true
| modbus | ReqResp | | modbus.ReqResp
| modbus | Payload | | modbus.Payload
#| enip | Command | == != < > <= >= | enip.Command > 0
#| enip | Length | == != < > <= >= | enip.Length > 5
#| enip | SessionHandle | == != < > <= >= | enip.SessionHandle != 0
#| enip | Status | == != < > <= >= | enip.Status != 0
#| enip | Options | == != < > <= >= | enip.Options == 0x02
#| enip | CommandSpecific | | enip.CommandSpecific

#| enip | SenderContext | | enip.SenderContext
#| cip | Response | ==true, !=true | cip.Response == true
#| cip | Service | == != < > <= >= | cip.Service == 0x02
#| cip | ClassID | == != < > <= >= | cip.ClassID == 0x00
#| cip | InstanceID | == != < > <= >= | cip.InstanceID == 0x01
#| cip | Status | == != < > <= >= | cip.Status != 0
#| cip | AdditionalStatus | | cip.AdditionalStatus
#| cip | Data | | cip.Data
