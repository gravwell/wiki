### Additions

* Added an indicator to Query Studio tabs to show when a query has been modified but has not been launched. Search results may be displayed from a previously launched search that does not match the query string currently displayed in the editor.
* Added a warning that appears when attempting to save a modified query to the Query Library.

### Improvements

* Improved replication validation during indexer start up. 

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a nil config could cause a crash during searchagent check-in handling.
* Fixed an issue in the webserver that could cause API response aborts when requesting overview stats that contained sparse data.
* Fixed a bug in the top/bottom modules that could cause indexer crashes when combined with transparent (or disabled) compression and used prior to a condensing search module.
