### Additions

* Added a fast check to see if a GUID is being tracked by an indexer before attempting to log or engage replication.

### Improvements

* Improved timeouts and retries before reporting that an indexer is down.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with replication locks causing queries to stall when there are lots of queries with lots of replication happening.
* Fixed an issue with quoting the scope of a syslog RFC5424 structured field where the SD ID contains a period.
* Fixed an issue with chunking when the block size is large with few entries.
* Fixed an issue where the searchagent would throw unnecessary "has not checked in" warnings.
* Fixed an issue where the incorrect access was shown for a Script in the list view when write access was shared with a group. The correct access was shown in the form page.
