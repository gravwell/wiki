## Gravwell

```{note}
This release contains a high priority bug fix for a security violation. This bug only impacts users on v5.8.0 and only occurs when using the `reingest` module with flags.
```

### Additions

* Added a new `evs()` function in the `eval` module. 
* Added a new `keys()` function in the `eval` module. 

### Improvements

* Improved AI Admin Announcement to be more suitable for self-hosted installations.
* Improved replication handling of tag changes when reconnecting. 
* Improved the performance of `json -x` queries by not copying the DATA field when it is not needed.
* Updated the inline time constraints to allow START and END keywords to be used in the main query.
* Upgraded JWT claims system.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where security permissions were ignored when using the `reingest` module with flags. A user could ingest into a tag without permission but would not be able to read from that tag.
* Fixed an issue where excluding other values in a chart would cause the other value magnitude to be misreported under a random key.
* Fixed an issue where start and end constraints in the query would not respect compound time units (e.g. 5m50s).
* Fixed an issue with replication where an indexer would stop responding to a listening port.
* Fixed an issue with replication where indexers could fail to push well configs.
* Fixed an issue where the Run Query - Advanced flow node failed to parse a duration string provided for the timeframe.
