This release contains a high priority bug fix for a security violation where secrets were not properly masked in error messages when running scripts. Secrets may be exposed in notifications or stored in log messages as a result of the script.
```

### Additions

* Added a flag in the [regex](/search/regex/regex.md) module to enable array mode, which extracts all matches of each capture group into array enumerated values.
* Added an [`evs_to_json()`](#eval-evs-to-json) function to the eval module to return a JSON object of all the EVs on a given entry.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where secrets were not properly masked in error messages when running scripts.
* Fixed an issue where the tooltip was incorrect for cron specs with multiple hour ranges.
* Fixed an issue where the webserver could sometimes lock-up when using direct search with a query attempting to write to a read-only resource.

## Ingester Changes
