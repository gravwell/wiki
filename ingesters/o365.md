# Office 365 Log Ingester

Gravwell provides an ingester for Microsoft Office 365 logs. The ingester can process all supported log types. In order to configure the ingester, you will need to register a new *application* within the Azure Active Directory management portal; this will generate a set of keys which can be used to access the logs. You will need the following information:

* Client ID: A UUID generated for your application via the Azure management console
* Client secret: A secret token generated for your application via the Azure console
* Azure Directory ID: A UUID representing your Active Directory instance, found in the Azure Active Directory dashboard
* Tenant Domain: The domain of your Office 365 domain, e.g. "mycorp.onmicrosoft.com"

## Basic Configuration

The O365 ingester uses the unified global configuration block described in the [ingester section](#!ingesters/ingesters.md#Global_Configuration_Parameters).  Like most other Gravwell ingesters, the O365 ingester supports multiple upstream indexers, TLS, cleartext, and named pipe connections, a local cache, and local logging.

[ContentType "general"]
	Content-Type="Audit.General"
	Tag-Name="365-general"

[ContentType "dlp"]
	Content-Type="DLP.All"
	Tag-Name="365-dlp"
```

## Installation and configuration

First, download the installer from the [Downloads page](#!quickstart/downloads.md), then install the ingester:

```
root@gravserver ~# bash gravwell_o365_installer.sh
```

If the Gravwell services are present on the same machine, the installation script should automatically extract and configure the `Ingest-Auth` parameter and set it appropriately. You will now need to open the `/opt/gravwell/etc/o365_ingest.conf` configuration file and set it up for your Office 365 account, replacing the placeholder fields and modifying tags as desired. Once you have modified the configuration as described below, start the service with the command `systemctl start gravwell_o365_ingest.service`

The example below shows a sample configuration which connects to an indexer on the local machine (note the `Pipe-Backend-target` setting) and feeds it logs from all supported log types:

```
[Global]
Ingest-Secret = IngestSecrets
Connection-Timeout = 0
Pipe-Backend-target=/opt/gravwell/comms/pipe #a named pipe connection, this should be used when ingester is on the same machine as a backend
Log-Level=ERROR #options are OFF INFO WARN ERROR
State-Store-Location=/opt/gravwell/etc/o365_ingest.state

Client-ID=79fb8690-109f-11ea-a253-2b12a0d35073
Client-Secret="<secret>"
Directory-ID=e8b7895e-109f-11ea-9dcc-93fb14b5dab5
Tenant-Domain=mycorp.onmicrosoft.com
